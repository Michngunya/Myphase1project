The incorrect wiring caused the antiskid system not to function as intended, resulting in the failure of the left outboard tire and a significant loss of the airplanes braking ability, which led to the runway overrun. Contributing to the accident were (1) Saabs design of the wheel speed transducer wire harnesses, which did not consider and protect against human error during maintenance; (2) the Federal Aviation Administrations lack of consideration of the runway safety area dimensions at Unalaska Airport during the authorization process that allowed the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and (3) the flight crewmembers inappropriate decision, due to their plan continuation bias, to land on a runway with a reported tailwind that exceeded the airplane manufacturers limit. The safety margin was further reduced because of PenAirs failure to correctly apply its company-designated pilot-in-command airport qualification policy, which allowed the accident captain to operate at one of the most challenging airports in PenAirs route system with limited experience at the airport and in the Saab 2000 airplane.",1/12/2021,0.7,42.0,0.8809523809523809,2.699471674829355e-05,0.2576271460340721
