# Aviation Risk Analysis Report 

## Project Overview

This project, prepared by **Michie's Insights Consultancy**, analyzes aviation data to determine the safest aircraft models for commercial and private operations. The analysis is focused on identifying risk factors such as survival rate, damage levels, incident frequency, and engine configurations.

## Key Objectives

* Identify **top-performing and high-risk aircraft models**.
* Analyze **engine type and number of engines** in relation to risk scores.
* Provide **data-driven business recommendations** for purchasing aircraft.

## Project Structure

1. **Introduction** – Overview of the report and contents.
2. **Data Loading & Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
3. **Key Indices** – Calculating Survival Index, Damage Index, and Risk Score.
4. **Visualizations** – Heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots highlighting key insights.
5. **Engine Analysis** – Risk scores for engine types, number of engines, and model-level risk.
6. **Summary & Recommendations** – Actionable insights for decision-making.

## Key Insights

* **Safest Models:** The top 5 aircraft models with the lowest risk scores show high survival rates and minimal damage indexes.
* **Riskiest Models:** The bottom 5 models have significantly higher risk scores, indicating more severe damage patterns and lower survival likelihood.
* **Engine Risk:**  
  - Certain **engine types** are consistently associated with lower risk scores.  
  - **Multi-engine aircraft** tend to show lower risk compared to single-engine configurations.  
  - Model-level analysis reveals which **aircraft models perform best within each engine type/number category**.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and reporting.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
3. Open the Jupyter notebook and run cells sequentially.
4. Review the **visualizations** and **summary recommendations**.

## Visualizations Included

* Correlation Heatmap of Risk Factors.
* Top & Bottom 10 Aircraft Models by Risk Score.
* Engine Type and Number of Engines vs. Risk.
* Model-level risk comparison by engine configuration.

## Recommendations Output

The final cells of the notebook summarize:

* **Safest and riskiest aircraft models**.
* **Engine-related risk insights** (safest engine types, safest engine counts).
* **Business recommendations for aircraft purchase** based on combined risk, durability, and survival indexes.
